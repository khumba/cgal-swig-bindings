	[a]CGAL::insert()
	[b]Point-location functions


[2]Test Files issues:-
	[c]cgal.Point_2.equals(p1,p2)	(compares p1 with origin,outputs bool on basis of that only)
	[d]cgal.Vector_2.equals(v1)	(crashes if v1 is NULL Vector)
	[e]cgal.Curve_2.new()           (return Segements only whatever type the function is overloaded for)
   	   [e.1]cgal.Curve_2.line(c1)	(not working because c1 is segment)
   	   [e.2]cgal.Curve_2.ray(c1)    (not working because c1 is segment)  	
	[f] cgal.Line_2.new		(Overloading Issues)
